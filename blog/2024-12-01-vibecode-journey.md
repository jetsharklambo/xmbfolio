# The Start of My VibeCode Journey

After years as a Learning and Development Leader at Fortune 500 companies, designing technology training for teams at Pandora, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and SiriusXM, I've discovered something exciting: the tools I used to teach others about technology have evolved into creative partners themselves.

## From Educator to Creator

My background as a Digital Education Producer and Event Operations Director taught me to bridge complex technological concepts with human understanding. I've spent my career creating workshops on emerging technologies, building accessibility training for technologists, and curating learning experiences that make the impossible feel approachable.

Now, I'm applying that same philosophy to my own creative journey—but this time, I'm not just teaching about technology. I'm **vibecoding** with it.

## The VibeCode Toolkit

**[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** has become my AI development partner, helping me build full-stack applications that would have taken months to prototype. Instead of wrestling with documentation, I'm having conversations about architecture and watching ideas come to life in real-time.

**[Midjourney](https://midjourney.com)** transforms my visual concepts into stunning art through the power of prompts. The same skills I used to craft clear training materials now help me communicate with AI to create images that capture the essence of ideas I couldn't draw myself.

**[Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com)** simplifies Web3 development, making smart contract deployment and blockchain integration as straightforward as traditional web development. No more drowning in Web3 complexity—just pure creative expression.

**[OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com)** provides the security foundation every blockchain project needs. Their audited smart contract libraries mean I can focus on innovation without compromising on safety.

## Beyond Traditional Development

This isn't just about learning new tools—it's about reimagining what's possible when education expertise meets creative technology. I'm building experiences that span Web2 and Web3, creating art that bridges digital and physical worlds, and developing applications that solve real problems for real communities.

The same curiosity that drove me to design learning experiences for emerging technologies now fuels my exploration of AI-assisted development, prompt engineering, and decentralized applications. Every project becomes a laboratory for discovering new ways humans and AI can collaborate.

## What's Next

This portfolio represents more than just projects—it's a living document of the VibeCode philosophy. Where traditional development meets AI assistance. Where visual imagination meets generative art. Where community problems meet blockchain solutions.

The journey from Oakland-based learning strategist to creative technologist is just beginning. The tools are ready. The community is building. The vibe is immaculate.

Let's create something extraordinary together.
